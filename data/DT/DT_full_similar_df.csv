Active big man with body control and lateral mobility

Shows pad level in the run game

Played in double digit games each of past ve seasons toughs out minor injuries","

Elite frame and length  largest wingspan of any defensive player at combine
Can force way through gaps when he nds the football and uses proper pad level
Flashes raw power to dent depth of the pocket

Weighed 363 pounds when he enrolled but dropped some weight and stayed conditioned
Durable  played every game past three seasons  including 26 straight starts","

Agile out of stance to cross the face of blockers and force way through gaps
Short area quickness helps him redirect in small spaces to nish tackles
Times snap well as a pass rusher
Plays with balance at contact to keep his eyes up and feet underneath him
Leverages strength to create movement
Violent  forceful hands  with a high activity level
Doesn t quit  quickly shifting to Plans B  C and D when Plan A doesn t work
Strong work ethic  in the classroom and on the field former defensive coordinator Al Golden  He prepares and practices at a high level  
Voted a 2024 team captain NFL scout  His dad played a dozen years in the league and is an even better person  so I know his son grew up
with a great role model  
His 66 career games played ranks second most in Notre Dame history","








Squatty  unorthodox body NFL scout  Just doesn t have an NFL body      Look around on Sundays  not many guys like him  
Can get blown off the ball by powerful angle blocks  clearing run room up the gut
More likely to end up where blockers want  rather than the other way around
Struggles to press off blocks once engaged
Counter measures are based more on eort than technique
Doesn t know the meaning of the word  quit   but often exerts a lot of eort without going anywhere

Owns an NFL frame  with long arms
Strikes blockers with force behind his hands at the point of attack
Can occasionally win with pure strength  driving defenders backwards
Plays with surprising quickness for his size
Able to dip and contort body when attempting to maneuver through gaps
Out of control at times but can plant his foot and make sharp turns to adjust
Short area range in run game to work a gap over and lasso the runner","








Averaged just 15 7 defensive snaps per game in 2024
Slow getting off blocks
Plays high  making it easier for leveraged blockers to uproot him
Game often moves too fast for his responses to blocking
Inconsistent countermeasures to double teams
Late piecing together rush plan during a play
Poor career tackle and backeld production
