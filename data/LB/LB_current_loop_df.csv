1988,239.0,Tyreem Powell,2025,LB,"










Impressive size speed athlete
Rare wingspan with arm length that makes offensive tackles jealous
Firm upward strike when using long arms to work off contact
Leverages gap with physicality
Builds up speed to close gap in backside pursuit
Length allows him to lasso and nish tackles better than most
Has value as blitzer on simulated pressures
Forced fumble late on 2024 Minnesota tape  which sparked a comeback win
Played all four seasons on punt coverages and has skill set for special teams
Voted a 2024 team captain his coaches give their stamps of approval","








Want to see him punch to his weight class consistently
Average trigger and tends to be a tick late driving downhill
Inconsistent edge setter and block shedder
Needs more leveraged approach to play under angle blocks
Doesn t have body twitch for easy redirects in space
Struggles matching tight ends down the seam
Plays with blinders on in coverage

Short but not small  with a developed build
Solid athlete and moves with body exibility to plant  drive or redirect
Pursuit quickness shined brightest as blitzer to work around or leap over blockers
Instinctive reads lead to accurate angles studies a lot of Fred Warner
Strong hands and routinely nishes tackle attempts he starts
Snis out slants and follows quarterback s eyes to the passing lane
Able to man up tight ends and stay attached outside the numbers
Mature  seless leader voted a team captain in 2024 NFL scout  He s made of the right stu  ","







Below average height and length
Fast ow player but a little sticky when moving laterally
Long armed lineman can give him a jolt and knock him off path
Can evade blockers former running back but inconsistent when attempting to punchseparate
Has enough athleticism for spot drop duties but instincts aren t as sharp in coverage
Will be 25 on draft weekend
Missed four games as senior because of leg injury Sept  2024 right knee injury at Senior Bowl Feb  2025
