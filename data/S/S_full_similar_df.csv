His best athletic trait is fluid balance for smooth transitions
Plays with urgency in his key and drive to make stops at the line of scrimmage in run game
Fast and sharp downhill angles raise chances of finishing open field tackles
Physical nisher throws body into the lower half of ball carrier grew up idolizing Troy Polamalu
Gauges play speed from depth to leverage the field and guard the sticks
Anticipates well from zone to undercut routes
Big  steady hands to pick off inaccurate throws
Didn t commit a coverage penalty over past two seasons 26 games
Detailed work ethic instilled in him at a young age by his grandfather","








Not a special athlete  with average at best speed
More controlled than sudden in open field movements
Inconsistent as a true man to man defender
Managed just two passes defended in 2024 ninth on the Hawkeyes
Eagerness to make plays as senior led to false steps
Arrives too hot at times as tackler and gets caught between wrapping and striking
Didn t play on punt coverage in college
Will be 25 as a rookie
