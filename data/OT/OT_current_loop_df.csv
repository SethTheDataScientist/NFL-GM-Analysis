Enormous size with matching arm length and wingspan
The earth rumbles when he moves  but he has basketball feet
Light feet out of stance to set up shop in pass pro see 2024 Miami tape
Strong as an ox  looks to get physical with his long arms on every snap
Can push defenders away from the pocket or into the ground  once he locks on
Puts that Princeton education to good use when dissecting stuntsblitzes
Makes heavy contact on down blocks
Not a slug when asked to execute kick outs or short pulls
Described as a  diligent worker  by his coaches
Experienced on both left and right side","






Sets tall and often caught lunging with upper half extended over his feet
Lack of sinkbend leaves him ill equipped to halt power rushers
Can do better job power stepping to answer inside counters
Hands tend to wander in run game  leaving him strained and off balance
Only one season of experience against FBS competition
Battled through injuries as junior at Princeton in 2023  which lingered into time at Iowa State and sidelined him for rst two games of 2024
