Served on Kentucky s Student Advisory Committee for four straight years
Started every game past three seasons  with experience at guard and center","






Average power when attempting to wash or torque defenders
Frame of an NFL blocker but below average arm length
Tends to overextend himself at the waist  falling off blocks

Recognizes things well inside and IDs blitzes and stunts
Firm initial strike and works hard to keep hands inside
Rolls his hips in run game to help his extension

Shorter arms fall below the threshold for some schemes
Mediocre lateral quickness  leaving him late to redirect
Not a people mover in run game
Overcommits on the move and can be knocked off balance

Leverage based blocker who uses shorter stature to his advantage

Described as a leader and one of hardest workers in North Carolina program  according to NFL scouts
Played a lot of football  61 career starts across all three interior offensive line positions","



Below average height and weight
Lacks ideal mass in lower half and is likely maxed out
Will get bullied backwards by NFL power
