# NFL-GM-Analysis
Model output from an analysis of NFL GMs. The data used for training is the draft picks from 2003 to 2024 drafts along with features about the prospects including athletic testing, consensus big board rank, and NGS scores. The model was trained to predict the class label of the GM most likely to draft that player.
